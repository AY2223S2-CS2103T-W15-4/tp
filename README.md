* This is **a software engineering project done by Team W15-4 from CS2103T(AY2223S2)**.<br>
  The aim of this project is to:
  * help Computer Science students to keep track of their internship applications
  * provide a flexible internship application management interface which includes CLI and GUI
* The project is based on an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _AddressBook-Level3_) used for managing contact details by [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/).
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `InternEase` because it eases the internship application management process via both well-implemented CLI and GUI to help users focus on their internship preparations.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[InternEase Product Website](https://ay2223s2-cs2103t-w15-4.github.io/tp/)**.
