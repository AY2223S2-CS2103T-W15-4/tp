### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `MixedPanel`, `NoteListPanel`, `TodoListPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `InternshipApplication` object residing in the `Model`.
* listens on each other in the `Ui` component, as `CommandBox` calls functions in `MainWindow` to `execute()` `Logic`.
* keeps a reference to other `Ui` component, as `MainWindow` keeps references of `NoteListPanel`, `InternshipListPanel` and `NoteListPanel` to implement the switching between each panel.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Clear_by feature
This section elaborated the `clear_by` feature by its functionality and the path of execution together with the `ClearByCommand` implementation. Uml diagrams are used to aid this description.

#### How CLEAR_BY Feature is implemented

The `clear_by` feature enables user to clear the internship applications in batch with the specific attribute and the specific keyword. There are 3 cases (attributes) available in this feature.
In `Logic` interface, `ClearByCommand` extends `Command` with a `ClearByCommand#execute` functionality. The parsing process is facilitated by both the `InternEaseParser#parse` and `ClearByCommandParser#parse`.

The workflow of a `clear_by` command during its execution is shown by the activity diagram below:
[!ClearByActivityDiagram](images/ClearByActivityDiagram.png)

There are 3 constructors `ClearByCommand::new` provided for 3 different cases stated below : 

* Case 1 : clear_by `COMPANY_NAME`
  * `PREFIX` should be set to `n`
  * Allows user to remove all internship applications with `ParamType=COMPANYNAME` fully match with the provided keyword.
  
* Case 2 : clear_by `JOB_TITLE`
  * `PREFIX` should be set to `j`
  * Allows user to remove all internship applications with `ParamType=JOBTITLE` fully match with the provided keyword.
  
* Case 3 : clear_by `STATUS`
  * `PREFIX` should be set to `s`, the keywords accepted include `NA, PENDING, RECEIVED, REJECTED, NO`.
  * Allows user to remove all internship applications with `ParamType=STATUS` fully match with the correct provided keyword.

>**Note:** 
> The assignation of cases will be done by `ClearByCommandParser#parse`, each unavailable fields will be set to null.

These operations are involved in the `Model` interface as `Model#getFilteredInternshipList`, `Model#addInternshipToCache` and `Model#deleteInternship`

The execution process of `Clear_by` is demonstrated by the sequence diagram below.
[!ClearByActivityDiagram](images/ClearBySequenceDiagram.png)

Given below is a step-wise explanation on `clear_by` mechanism's behaviour.

Step 1. Parsing
    The user input in the `CommandBox` will trigger `CommandBox#execute`, will result in the command word processing in `InternEaseParser#parse`. If the `COMMAND.WORD` matches `clear_by`, it will then be passed to `ClearByCommandParser#parse`.
    The `PREFIX` in the argument will then be investigated. Different constructor of `ClearByCommand` object will be using based on the `PREFIX`.

Step 2. Execution
    `ClearByCommand#execute` is called with `model` instance. It attempts to get full list of `Internship Applications` by `Model#getFilteredInternshipList`. Then, the list is filtered by `ClearByCommand#getFilteredList` to filter out the applications to be cleared.
    The size of the list-to-clear is checked before an iteration to `Model#deleteInternship` and `Model#addInternshipToCache`. The cleared items are stored in the cache list to support `RevertCommand` in current InternEase session.

Step 3. Result
    The result model is saved. A `CommandResult` with execution result message is returned until the `MainWindow#execute`. The `InternshipListPanel` is refreshed with a `ResultDialog` displaying the execution message for 2.5 seconds.

>**NOTE:** 
> Error handling: Any error message resulted in the midst of execution will be displayed as a `ResultDialog` and current execution terminates immediately.

#### Why is it implemented this way

The `ClearByCommand` is an enhanced feature for both `DeleteCommand` and `ClearCommand`. It resolves user's request to perform customized batch deletion of internship applications.
Based on utility, the 3 fixed fields in an internship application are taken as the key attributes for this `clear_by` feature. The `PREFIX` for specifying the `clear_by` attribute is also the same as InternEase convention.
For the ease of implementation and avoid ambiguity, constructor `ClearByCommand::new` is overloaded, taking different fields. The usage of enum `ParamType` to specify the operating attribute type generalized the `ClearByCommand#execute`.
The other implementation aspects of `clear_by` feature follow the convention of `InternEase`.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
    * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
