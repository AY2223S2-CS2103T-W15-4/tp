### Project: InternEase

InternEase is a **powerful and innovative desktop app designed to streamline the internship application process** for **Computer Science undergraduates**. With its optimized **combination of a Command Line Interface (CLI) and Graphical User Interface (GUI)**, InternEase offers users the best of both worlds - the speed and efficiency of a CLI for those who can type quickly, and the user-friendly experience of a GUI for those who prefer a visual interface. InternEase is a good choice for you who wants to concentrate on your internship preparation by helping to manage your internship applications' data.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=zm-l&breakdown=true)

* **New Feature**:
    * Manage an internship application
      * What it does: Users are able to add and edit internship application
      * Justification: This feature allows the user, an internship applicant in this case to add and edit an internship application they have.
      * Highlights: Regular expressions are used to ensure user are typing in correct informations. Some fields are left as optional to give user more freedom to insert relevant details.
      * Credits: Some parts of the code was reused and adapted from the [AB3 project](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2223S2/tp) created by the [SE-EDU initiative]
